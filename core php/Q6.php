<?php 
/*

Superglobals in PHP are built-in variables that are always accessible, 
regardless of scope â€” you can access them from anywhere in a script 
(inside or outside functions/classes) without needing to declare them
global.


 five types of super global arrays in PHP are:

    a) $_GET:-
    --> This array contains the data that was sent to the script via the HTTP GET method.
    b) $_POST:- 
    --> This array contains the data that was sent to the script via the HTTP POST method.
    C) $_COOKIE:- 
    --> This array contains the data that was sent to the script via the HTTP COOKIE method.
    d) $_FILES:- 
    --> This array contains the data that was sent to the script via the HTTP FILE method.
    e) $_SESSION:- 
    --> This array contains the data that was sent to the script via the HTTP SESSION method.
